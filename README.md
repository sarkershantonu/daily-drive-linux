# Why Linux : 
- When I was in colleage , I was introduced to ReadHat back in 2005. I was very familer with linux though I am using windows since 2020 (my first PC). 
- From 2015, I am daily driving linux to my development PC, mostly used for tools and coding Java, python, C(though i have windows as my meeting PC, usually low specification). Since valve take over linux handheld gaming, the desktop experience becomes smoodther, so I am fully moving to linux. Mainly two versions, ubuntu LTS & fedora workstation (my pc and wife laptop).
- This repo will help anyone lke me fully move to daily drive linux. I also have proxmox since 2017 for as my homelab. 
- BTW.. I use zorin for my TV PCs , which is very good for people familier with windows. 
- You shoould find executable scripts in different destro folder here. I have single executable script for setting up my regular APPs for linux.
